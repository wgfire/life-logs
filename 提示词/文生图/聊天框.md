Hyper-realistic top-down macro photography. A long, light green WhatsApp speech bubble acting as a dining table. Two real living humans (shrunk to tiny scale) are sitting at opposite ends. They are NOT plastic figures; they have visible skin texture, natural hair, and realistic clothing folds. They are eating real food that looks freshly cooked, not play-doh. The text inside reads: "INSERT TEXT". Bottom right has a timestamp '3:33 PM' and blue ticks. The background is completely filled with a high-density, seamless WhatsApp doodle pattern (line art icons) covering the entire surface edge-to-edge with no empty spaces, resembling the original dense WhatsApp wallpaper. Professional studio lighting, 8k resolution, sharp focus.
